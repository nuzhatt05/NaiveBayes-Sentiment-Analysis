# Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis - Blog Posts

This repository is focused on implementing **Naive Bayes for text classification** and performing **sentiment analysis** on the `blogs_categories.csv` dataset.  
The assignment demonstrates preprocessing, feature extraction, Naive Bayes classification, and sentiment distribution analysis.

---

## Objective
To classify blog posts into categories using **Naive Bayes** and analyze the **sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)** of each post.  
This assignment strengthens understanding of text preprocessing, NLP feature extraction, classification, and sentiment analysis.

## Tasks Performed
* **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** loaded dataset, cleaned text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal), tokenization  
* **Feature Extraction:** transformed text into numerical form using TF-IDF  
* **Naive Bayes Classifier:** trained model on blog posts, predicted categories on test set  
* **Sentiment Analysis:** analyzed blog text for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment; examined sentiment distribution across categories  
* **Model Evaluation:** evaluated classifier using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
* **Insights:** summarized classification performance and sentiment analysis findings
